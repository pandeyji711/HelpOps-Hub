1. **Be Concise and Descriptive**: Summarize the change in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand at a glance.
2. **Use the Imperative Mood**: Write as if giving a command (e.g., `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`), which is a convention in many projects.
3. **Include Context**: Provide context or reason for the change if it‚Äôs not immediately obvious from the summary.
4. **Reference Issues and Pull Requests**: Include `issue numbers` or PR references if the commit addresses them.
5. **Issue reference** (Optional): Include the issue number associated with the commit (e.g., `#123`).
